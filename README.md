# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe in the C programming language.

# A little about decor
The initial field for the game is filled with units, the first player walks with zeros, and the second with eights (I took the eight as a cross, since it is the most similar to him of all the numbers).
If you want to fill in a cell that has already been moved to, you will not be able to do this, the game will block the action and ask you to enter the value again in another cell that has not been previously moved to.
After winning the first or second player, congratulations await him.
